<!-- Example Code 3: In the example, we changed the icon that appears in the browser tab when we open the app. We used an icon in which “Pf” is written because we are focusing to develop author’s portfolio. You can use either your own icon or download our PNG file by click on following button. Our file is in PNG format. You will have to convert it into .ico file by yourself. -->
